BEIJING GNU/LINUX USER GROUP CANARY (2/4)
====================================

Issued for August 2017.

Don't just trust the contents of this file blindly! Verify the
digital signatures! Also, make sure the keys are correct!

Signers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* biergaizi: 0xFAD3EB05E88E8D6D
* tonghuix : 0x5C25CFECA6D42018
* persmule : 0x6BF779266DD067C1

FOUR DOCUMENTS IN TOTAL.

You should verify all signatures from each of the maintainers, the next
one is located at:

* https://beijinglug.club/wiki/doku.php?id=blug-canary-3

It is possible that the signatures are not updated at the same time,
but eventually all canary documents should be consistent, signed and updated
by all current maintainers of Beijing GNU/Linux User Group in a short time.

Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. All our infrastructure is in our control, the integrity of our
entire system is sound.

2. We have not been compromised or suffered a recent data breach,
as far as we know.

3. We have not disclosed any private encryption keys.

4. We have not been forced to modify our system to allow access or
information leakage to a third party.

5. We haven't received any specific orders, requests or recommendations
from any authorities, whether formal or informal.

6. We have not received any court orders, gag orders, or other similar
orders from the government of the People's Republic of China.

7. We have not received any government subpoenas.

8. Our personal safety and security is not threatened.

9. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first
three weeks of September 2017. Special note should be
taken if no new canary is published by that time or if the list of statements
changes without plausible explanation.

Special Announcements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Switched from feedstail to rsstail, since rsstail is more common to find
in different systems, and switched from Reuters to BBC due to HTTPS support.

2. The canary for July 2017 produced a broken link in the third document.
This was caused by an off-by-one bug in the shell script. The bug was identified
and fixed now, but the original canary is kept as-is for historical purposes.
