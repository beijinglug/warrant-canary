BEIJING GNU/LINUX USER GROUP CANARY (3/4)
====================================

Issued for November 2017.

Don't just trust the contents of this file blindly! Verify the
digital signatures! Also, make sure the keys are correct!

Signers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* biergaizi: 0xFAD3EB05E88E8D6D
* tonghuix : 0xF9EFC7D7C953EC9C
* persmule : 0x2987A25DAC8454A5
* wnereiz  : 0xFDFF2E13AA25BE72

FOUR DOCUMENTS IN TOTAL.

You should verify all signatures from each of the maintainers, the next
one is located at:

* https://beijinglug.club/wiki/doku.php?id=blug-canary-4

It is possible that the signatures are not updated at the same time,
but eventually all canary documents should be consistent, signed and updated
by all current maintainers of Beijing GNU/Linux User Group in a short time.

Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. All our infrastructure is in our control, the integrity of our
entire system is sound.

2. We have not been compromised or suffered a recent data breach,
to our best knowledge.

3. We have not disclosed any private encryption keys.

4. We have not been forced to modify our system to allow access or
information leakage to a third party.

5. We haven't received any specific orders, requests or recommendations
from any authorities, whether formal or informal.

6. We have not received any court orders, gag orders, or other similar
orders from the government of the People's Republic of China.

7. We have not received any government subpoenas.

8. Our personal safety and security is not threatened.

9. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first three
weeks of December 2017. Special note should be taken if no new canary is
published by that time or if the list of statements changes without plausible explanation.

Special Announcements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. In October 2017, tonghuix failed to publish the canary for in a timely manner,
this is a mistake rather than an indication of security compromise of any type.

2. In October 2017, wnereiz published a canary document, but the statements were
not consistent with the other three canary documents. This is a mistake because an
outdated template from September was used accidentally, instead of the latest version.

3. We'll take measures to ensure that similar mistakes won't be made in the future.
