It is possible that the signatures are not updated at the same time,
but eventually all canary documents should be consistent, signed and updated
by all current maintainers of Beijing GNU/Linux User Group in a short time.

Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. All our infrastructure is in our control, the integrity of our
entire system is sound.

2. We have not been compromised or suffered a recent data breach,
to our best knowledge.

3. We have not disclosed any private encryption keys.

4. We have not been forced to modify our system to allow access or
information leakage to a third party.

5. We haven't received any specific orders, requests or recommendations
from any authorities, whether formal or informal.

6. We have not received any court orders, gag orders, or other similar
orders from the government of the People's Republic of China.

7. We have not received any government subpoenas.

8. Our personal safety and security is not threatened.

9. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first
three weeks of October 2017. Special note should be taken if no new
canary is published by that time or if the list of statements changes
without plausible explanation.

Special Announcements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Two personal key rotations have occured, tonghuix and persmule have
changed their PGP public keys. Reason of the key rotations is the personal
practice of information security. None of the keys have been compromised.

2. You can validate the new keys by reading the other two copies of this
document, signed by biergaizi and wnereiz. Or by checking the Web of Trust.

3. Statement No.2 is improved to use formal language, it is not a result of
any incidents.
