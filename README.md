If a bird flies away, SO SHOULD YOU.

TWO canaries were fed on time, see:
https://github.com/beijinglug/warrant-canary/tree/master/2020-February

*Due to personal reason, biergaizi was not available and couldn't sign
the warrant canary before the end of February, 2020. A replacement
canary for February, 2020 has been signed retroactively by biergaizi
in March, 2020 to verify its statements are still valid.*

TWO canaries were fed, see:

*Due to an OpenPGP key expiration and rotation issue overlooked by us,
it was impossible for persmule to sign the warrant canary using the
expired signing key. Thus, only two canary documents were signed.

for details and clarifications.*
