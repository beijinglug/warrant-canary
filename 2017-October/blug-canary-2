Statements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. All our infrastructure is in our control, the integrity of our
entire system is sound.

2. We have not been compromised or suffered a recent data breach,
to our best knowledge.

3. We have not disclosed any private encryption keys.

4. We have not been forced to modify our system to allow access or
information leakage to a third party.

5. We haven't received any specific orders, requests or recommendations
from any authorities, whether formal or informal.

6. We have not received any court orders, gag orders, or other similar
orders from the government of the People's Republic of China.

7. We have not received any government subpoenas.

8. Our personal safety and security is not threatened.

9. We plan to publish the next of these canary statements in the first three
weeks of November 2017. Special note should be taken if no new canary is
published by that time or if the list of statements changes without plausible explanation.

Special Announcements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. BLUG has migrated the server hosting to another datacenter and fresh
installed the operating system. No security incidents or compromise
occured before, after, and during the migration.

2. tonghuix failed to publish the canary for October in a timely manner,
this is a mistake rather than an indication of security compromise of
any type. This document is published as the canary of October and correction
of the mistake. We'll take measures to ensure that similar mistakes won't
be made in the future.
